                        <h1>The Story Behind Lucky Shrub</h1>
                        <p>Lucky Shrub was founded in 2015 in Tucson, Arizona, born from the shared dream of Jason and Maria to turn their lifelong passion for plants into something bigger. After years of tending to their own garden and helping friends with theirs, the couple realized that their unique blend of creativity, knowledge, and love for nature could become something more than a hobby. Frustrated by the lack of holistic garden services in their area—where design, planting, and maintenance often came from different providers—they decided to build a company that offered it all under one roof. With Jason’s background in landscape architecture and Maria’s expertise in communication and marketing, they combined their strengths and poured their hearts into every detail. What started as a small local business has since grown into a trusted name for garden design and plant lovers across Tucson. For them, Lucky Shrub isn't just a company—it's a reflection of their belief that every space deserves a little green magic.</p>

                    <p>Jason is the creative mind behind every garden Lucky Shrub designs.

As head of design, Jason works closely with clients to understand their needs, then leads a skilled team of landscapers to bring each vision to life. His designs balance beauty with functionality and always reflect the unique character of Arizona’s environment. From private gardens to public spaces, Jason’s mission is simple: to create living environments that bring joy and lasting value.</p>

                    <h2>Maria – The Heart of the Brand</h2>
                    <p>Maria brings energy, strategy, and a green thumb to Lucky Shrub’s daily operations. As the company’s marketing manager and co-founder, she handles everything from brand identity to customer engagement. But her work doesn’t stop there – Maria also oversees the on-site nursery, carefully selecting and curating a collection of indoor and outdoor plants that complement their design projects. With a background in communications and a love for community, she ensures that Lucky Shrub not only delivers quality, but also builds lasting relationships. For Maria, it’s about more than just plants – it’s about growing a business that feels like family.</p>

Task project of the Front-End-Developer course on Coursera. Nr.1 of 4.

This project isn't including responsive designs for now and only work on desktop fine.

Task: 
For the graded assessment, you need to develop a home page for one of four fictional clients. As you read through the client personas included in this reading, think about what the ideal home page for each of these clients would look like.   

How can you use what you’ve learned over the course? For instance, how will you structure the provided information with semantic HTML tags? You can even start to think about what media elements you could include.   

And how can you create a unique user experience with CSS? Will a grid or basic flexbox serve the client best? What CSS selectors will you use to not only style your page but also create interactivity? And don’t forget about effects! It’s time to have fun and think about how you can apply what you learned about CSS animations.   

fictional client persona: 
Based in Tuscon, Arizona, Lucky Shrub is a medium-sized garden design firm that specializes in garden design and creation, maintenance and landscaping. The company also runs a small plant nursery that sells indoor and outdoor plants, making them a one-stop shop for clients to "transform any space into an oasis you can be proud of".

Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria, who share a long-time love for plants. Jason is the garden architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing his team of landscapers. Maria manages all the marketing for the company and oversees the nursery.
